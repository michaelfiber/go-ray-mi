# go-ray-mi
C examples from [here](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/tree/master/examples) converted to go with the least changes possible and not using bindings.

Not necessay done the "go" way, since it's very quickly done for fun.

Built and tested on Ubuntu 22.04. You'll have to update the CGo comments at the top for other platforms.
